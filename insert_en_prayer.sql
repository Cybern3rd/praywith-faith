  'Reflecting on the miracle of the season', 
  E'Dear God,\n\nOn this holy night, as we gather to celebrate the birth of your son, we are filled with a sense of awe and wonder. We reflect on the miracle of your love, which has brought us together in this moment of unity and joy. As we light our candles and sing our carols, may we find solace in the knowledge that you are always with us, guiding us through the darkness and illuminating our path with your love.\n\nMay this Christmas Eve bring us closer to each other and to you. May we find peace and comfort in the knowledge that you are always by our side, and that your love is a constant in our lives.\n\nWe ask that you bless this night with your presence, and that you fill our hearts with the joy and hope that comes from knowing that you are with us.\n\nIn the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.',
